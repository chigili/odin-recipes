    <h2>Lasagna Preparation</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a type of wide, flat pasta, possibly one of the oldest types of pasta. Lasagna, or the singular lasagna, commonly refers to a culinary dish made with stacked layers of pasta alternated with sauces and ingredients such as meats, vegetables and cheese, and sometimes topped with melted grated cheese. Typically, the cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting lasagna casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Spinach</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook and stir beef until brown. Add onions, garlic and oregano; saute until onions are transparent. Stir in sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, tomatoes and tomato paste; simmer for 30 minutes. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining salt and parsley.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
